When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

So that many ppl can work together on the same project ie open source or just a colaberation 
Also so that you can work from multi computers
and even more so for larger programming task at a bigger work place. 


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather then having git automatically stat up to date with your remote repository=

Because maybe you are working on something on your local machine and do not want it updated to the master that is online. 


Describe the differences between forks,clonse,braches. when would use one instead of the other

clone: pull from the internet to your local. used when taking some code online

fork: when you clone a repository but you keep it on your github page. used when working together on a project online and keeps track of who originally started the repository. 

branches: created on 1 repository on your local machine. is used so that you can track and modify the code without change or causing a errors in your naster ( good code).


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

if something happens to the github repository and there is some type of issue with the program it would be good to have the one saved locally. plus you can look through and see changes.
