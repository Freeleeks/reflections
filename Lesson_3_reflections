When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

So that many ppl can work together on the same project ie open source or just a colaberation 
Also so that you can work from multi computers
and even more so for larger programming task at a bigger work place. 


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather then having git automatically stat up to date with your remote repository=

Because maybe you are working on something on your local machine and do not want it updated to the master that is online.
